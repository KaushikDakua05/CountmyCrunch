 * Instead of extending the ViewModel class we'll extend an Android view model.
Both classes work the same way.
AndroidViewModel is a subclass of ViewModel,
but it also has an application property.
That's going to be useful if we want to access the database,
because we'll need an application to get a ContentResolver.
